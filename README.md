# 2-D_Melee
This is a 2-D side-scroller game based on the Super Smash Bros Donkey Kong map developed with Java. The objective is to not go off the screen and to hit the opponent to increase their damage percentage. Map data is loaded by streaming a .txt file and the BufferedImage library is utilized for displaying graphics. I also programmed an audio enum to play multiple sound effects and background music using AudioInputStream. Furthermore, platform movement, map scrolling, and player trajectories were implemented using math and physics formulas. Threading is implemented to run continuous updates of the map and player states in the background. All the artwork was created by hand with Pixlr Editor and Microsoft Paint.
